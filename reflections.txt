You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  	I have learnt figure, super and other tags and to lookup html elements and their usages on MDN reference pages.
  	I have installed the udacity chrome extension.
  * What has been easy?
  	Apply tags to html documents after found out their usages.
  * What has been difficult?
  	Ensuring the mockup and html document are the same.  Because this step I have to basically do eyeball test and I am bound to miss things by just looking at them.
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
  	Yes.  The test and modify workflow is working here.
